# NPM-Resume

This is a small project that I did so anyone can easily view my resume by simply installing an NPM package. Feel free to install and check it out from the command line.

## Get Started

To install globally in Mac, enter:

```
sudo npm install -g guillonapa-cv
```

To install globally in Windows, enter:

```
npm install -g guillonapa-cv
```

After you have installed the package globally, you can enter in the command line from anywhere `guillonapa-cv` to see my resume.

## Preview

This project consists of a simple "user" loop using `inquirer.js`. Some basic linting, mocha testing, and code transpiling is done using `Grunt`. Starting the package from the command line looks something like this:



## Code

I took inspiration from [this](https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-make-your-r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9-an-npm-package-fc5d6b6a3fbd) article, which I also encourage you to check out.
